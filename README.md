## Dependencies

When installing plugins from local directories, the tool will automatically read the `plugin.yml` file and install any listed dependencies.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing `plugin.yml` file**:  
  If the plugin doesn't contain a `plugin.yml` file with dependencies, the tool will skip dependency installation.
  
- **Permission errors**:  
  Ensure that you have appropriate permissions for installing plugins and accessing the required directories.
